# Unity-Github Integration Setup

<b>Please follow this guide in the order it has been laid out</b>. I've put a lot of care into this guide, so hopefully it helps you into understanding how we'll be using both Unity and Github together for this project. If you run into issues at any point in this guide, please let me know immediately so I can resolve it for you and everyone else following along!

## Prerequisites

### Please make sure you have the following   

Unity Hub and Unity Version <b>2022.3.20f1 (LTS)</b>. 
* When configuring the Unity installation, make sure to include the WebGL Build Support module. If you already have VS Code installed onto your device, feel free to uncheck that module during installation.   

Github Account   

Github Desktop installed   

## Video

Make sure to watch the collaboration portion of [this video](https://youtu.be/pNUdu-6ZNBg?si=-FOwMfU7eczPLAok&t=294). I have already set the video to play where you should begin watching; <b>please watch from that breakpoint to the end</b>. This short exercise is meant to get you familiar with how you'll pull and push the project, commit changes, create branches, and merge branches to the main branch. It is very important that you have a solid understanding of these concepts and how they'll be used for this project.

## Github Repository Request

Next, please fill out [this form](https://discord.com/channels/1165122446932836373/1211931900826882118). If this link does not work for you, please make sure you've been assigned our role for the dev team. You will be notified by email once you've been assigned as a collaborator.

## Cloning the Repo

Once you're a collaborator, you can finally clone the repository onto your local machine. It is <b>strongly recommended</b> that you watch the video again as you complete this step (from 4:53 to 7:15). This will also ensure that you fully understand how to safely commit and push any changes you make to the project.

## Finished!

You're all set! As long as you followed this guide, you should (hopefully) see a functioning Unity project on your local machine! If you have any suggestions or comments on how I can improve this guide, please let me know!
